    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is going to be a personal website. I will even include a message box.</p>
    <p>Please do not troll or send inappropriate messages. I had to remove the option to send images because some people kept spamming inappropriate content. From now on, it's only a text message input box. This is just a non-professional personal website project I did a long time ago.</p>
   
    <p>Who am I? Well, obviously, I am not going to dox myself and say my full name here. You can judge by the free domain name. This is equivalent to a social media page for me. If you came here, I probably gave you the website address myself, so if you do not know me in person, trust me, this website is not worth your time.</p>
    <p>meh this is hosted on cloudfare and i will even put the link to the github so all open source for anybody who wants the original project
        https://github.com/aerithic/muhammadwebsite have fun, it's just an html file with pics :).
